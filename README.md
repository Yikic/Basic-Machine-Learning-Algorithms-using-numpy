# Basic-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-using-numpy
All the algorithms introduced below are in utils.py, every algorithm has a Examples below the class, you can run the algoithm quickly by the given Examples
## LogisticRegression
Optimizer is Newton's Method
## Gaussian Descriminant Analysis
The supervised learning version of Gaussian Mixture Model
## Locally Weighted Linear Regression
Add the attention mechanism into linear regression to fit a non-linear model
## Naive Bayes
Used for language processing, eg. spam classification or sentiment analysis
## Perceptron
It's a single perceptron with kernel trick
## Support Vector Machine
### hard margin
Hard margin version is only for doing language processing
### soft margin
Soft margin version is implemented refer to Platt's paper which introduce SMO algorithm in dealing with KKT condition
## Decision Tree
Using ratio to pick the best spilt feature
## Random Forest
Using bootstrap to pick samples, and pick random features to plant decision trees
## Neural Network
